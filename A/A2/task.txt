Description 

 

Create a C# Console application that is a reservation system for a car rental company. The company provides services for three different types of customers: Regular, Premium, and VIP. 

 

Business Logic 

 

Each customer has the following information recorded about them: 

 

- Customer ID (6-digit alphanumeric code) 

- Name 

- Phone Number 

- Customer Type (Regular, Premium, VIP) – Customer Types should be program constants, where Regular is 0, Premium is 1 and VIP is 2 

 

The company offers the following car rental services to all customers: 

 

- Economy Car Rental - $29.99/day 

- Standard Car Rental - $49.99/day 

- Luxury Car Rental - $79.99/day 

 

The company also offers one additional service depending on the customer type: 

 

- Regular - GPS Navigation - $9.99/day 

- Premium - Child Car Seat - $14.99/day 

- VIP - Chauffeur Service - $99.99/day 

 

Program 

 

Create a menu with 4 (four) menu options: 

 

1. Create a reservation 

- Enter customer information (customer ID, name, phone number and customer type – using the according customer type constant number). 

- Choose the car type from the available options. The options should include prices. 

- Choose if the customer wants the available additional service (also showing the price), using a yes/no input. 

 

2. List all Reservations 

   - Display each customer and all their information, including the services they want. The customer ID should be displayed with the first three characters replaced by Xs (e.g., XXX999). 

   - Display the total price. 

 

3. Clear All Reservations 

 

4. Exit the program

The MINIMUM requirements for this program are as follows (but not limited to): 

 

- Appropriate class structure with all properties and methods placed in the proper classes. 

- A list of Services and Reservations MUST be used. 

- One instance of inheritance must be used. 

- One instance of an interface must be used. 

- "Hardcode" 3 customers, so that when you start your program, add them to the first 3 slots of the reservation list. The first customer must be you. 

 

Submission 

 

A single compressed (.zip format) archive file containing the entire project folder for the program. 

 

Reminder; DO NOT CHEAT 

 

It will be tempting to work on this with a friend. Do not do that. I will find out. You will get zero and receive a misconduct in the course. There are several hundred different ways to write this program. It will be almost impossible to have similar code to anyone else in this course if you wrote it yourself. 

 

This is your only warning.
