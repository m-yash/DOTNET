Create a C# console application for a grocery billing system that allows customers to select items, apply a loyalty card discount, and calculate the final cost with tax. 

1. Display predefined grocery (or any store) items along with their prices.  

2. Ask the user if they have a loyalty card (yes/no) 

3. Allow the user to select items by specifying the quantity of each item they want to purchase (enter 0 for none). 

4. Calculate the subtotal for the selected items. 

5. Apply a 10% discount if the user has a loyalty card (yes). 

6. Calculate a 13% tax on the subtotal. 

7. Display a receipt with the selected items, subtotal, tax amount, and the final total after applying the discount and tax.
